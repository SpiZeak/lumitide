# Lumitide

A terminal music player for Tidal, written in Rust.

> [!WARNING]
> **If you are on v1.4.0 or earlier, please update to the latest version.**
> Tidal changed their streaming API — playback and downloads will fail on older versions.
> Grab the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/BreakLime/lumitide/releases) page or re-run the installer.

Stream audio from your Tidal account directly in the terminal, with album art, a live spectrum visualizer, beat/drop detection, and a background download queue.

> [!NOTE]
> **Audio quality is platform-dependent.** Windows and Linux use the Tidal desktop app auth flow (PKCE) and stream/download **lossless FLAC**. macOS uses a device code flow and receives **MP4 (HIGH quality / AAC)**.
> See [docs/how-flac-works.md](docs/how-flac-works.md) for a full technical write-up of the auth flow and stream decryption.

## Features

- **Stream** audio from Tidal in real time — **lossless FLAC** on Windows/Linux, **MP4/AAC** (HIGH quality) on macOS
- **Album cover art** rendered as Braille characters in the terminal
- **Spectrum visualizer** with peak-hold bars and beat/drop detection
- **Album-art color theming** — title, spectrum bars, and transition arrows all take their color from the current cover
- **Pywal integration** — optionally sync the color scheme with your [Pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) wallpaper palette
- **Library** — browse liked tracks, saved albums, and followed artists with fuzzy search; auto-advances through results with track counter and animated transitions
- **Mix mode** — browse and play your curated Tidal mixes with animated track transitions
- **Playlist mode** — browse and play your Tidal playlists
- **Radio** — press `r` on any track to start a Tidal radio seeded from it
- **Add to playlist / favorites** — press `a` while a track plays to like it or add it to one of your playlists, without interrupting playback
- **Search** — find tracks by title or artist
- **Local playback** — shuffle local FLAC, MP3, and M4A files with the same UI
- **Download** — press `d` while a track is playing to save it to disk; or press `d` on any album, mix, playlist, or track in a list view to queue it for **background download** without interrupting playback or navigation
- **Download queue** — a live `⬇ Artist - Title  N / M` indicator appears at the bottom-right of every screen while the queue is running; total grows as you queue more
- **Media key support** — control playback via media keys; track metadata and album art shown in Windows taskbar/lock screen and macOS Control Center

## Requirements

- A [Tidal](https://tidal.com) HiFi or HiFi Plus subscription
- A terminal with **truecolor** (24-bit) support (Windows Terminal, iTerm2, Alacritty, Kitty, etc.)

## Installation

### Quick install (one-liner)

**Linux / macOS:**
```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BreakLime/lumitide/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BreakLime/lumitide/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Both scripts download the latest prebuilt binary for your platform and drop it somewhere on your `PATH`.

Pin a specific release:
```sh
# Linux / macOS
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BreakLime/lumitide/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --version vX.Y.Z

# Windows (PowerShell)
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BreakLime/lumitide/main/install.ps1))) -Version vX.Y.Z
```

To uninstall, remove the binary and undo the changes the installer made:
- **Linux / macOS:** `rm ~/.local/bin/lumitide`
- **Windows:** delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\lumitide`, remove the `Lumitide` shortcut from `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs`, and remove `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\lumitide` from your User PATH (Settings → System → About → Advanced system settings → Environment Variables).

### Download (recommended)

Grab the latest release for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/BreakLime/lumitide/releases) page.

| Platform | File | Type |
|----------|------|------|
| Windows | `lumitide-installer.exe` | Installer — Start Menu shortcut, uninstaller, optional PATH |
| Windows | `lumitide-windows.exe` | Portable — just download and run, no install needed |
| Linux | `lumitide-linux` | Portable binary |
| macOS | `lumitide-macos` | Portable binary |

**Windows installer:** run `lumitide-installer.exe` and follow the wizard. Lumitide will appear in your Start Menu.

**Windows portable:** double-click `lumitide-windows.exe` or run it from a terminal.

**Linux / macOS:** make it executable first:
```sh
chmod +x lumitide-linux  # or lumitide-macos
./lumitide-linux
```

Optionally move it somewhere on your `PATH` so you can run it from anywhere:
```sh
mv lumitide-linux ~/.local/bin/lumitide
```

### Build from source

Requires the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BreakLime/lumitide.git
cd lumitide
cargo build --release
./target/release/lumitide
```

**Linux** also needs the ALSA development headers:
```sh
sudo apt install libasound2-dev  # Debian / Ubuntu
sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel  # Fedora
```

## Authentication

Authentication is handled automatically on first run and differs by platform.

**Windows** — Lumitide opens a browser window for the Tidal login page. After
you log in, the OS redirects back to Lumitide automatically and the session is
saved. No copy-pasting required.

**Linux / macOS** — Lumitide prints a URL and a short code:

```
To log in to Tidal, visit:
  https://link.tidal.com/...
And enter code: ABCD-1234

Waiting for authorisation...
```

Visit the URL, enter the code, and approve the login.

In both cases your session is saved to `~/.config/lumitide/session.json` and
refreshed automatically on subsequent runs.

## Usage

Running `lumitide` with no arguments opens an interactive menu:

```
> Search
  My mixes
  My playlists
  My library
  Local files
  Config
  Quit
```

CLI usage is also fully supported:

```sh
lumitide search "Netsky"               # search tracks by title
lumitide search "Chase The Sun" -n 20  # increase result count
lumitide mix                           # browse and play your Tidal mixes
lumitide library                       # browse liked tracks, saved albums, followed artists
lumitide local                         # shuffle local audio files
lumitide config                        # open the config file in your editor
```

## Key Bindings

### During playback

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `→` / `n` | Next track |
| `←` / `p` | Previous track |
| `Space` | Pause / resume |
| `↑` / `+` | Volume up |
| `↓` / `-` | Volume down |
| `a` | Add current track to a playlist or favorites (picker overlay; playback continues) |
| `d` | Download current track to disk |
| `r` | Start radio from current track |
| `?` | Toggle controls overlay |
| `q` / `Esc` | Go back |

### In list views (library, search, mixes, playlists)

|-----|--------|
| `↑` / `↓` or `k` / `j` | Navigate |
| `Enter` | Play selected item |
| `d` | Queue selected item for background download |
| `Esc` / `q` | Go back |

## Configuration

Run `lumitide config` to open the config menu. Settings are stored at
`~/.config/lumitide/config.json`.

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `output_dir` | — | Directory for downloaded tracks (set on first run) |
| `volume` | `0.5` | Playback volume (0.0–1.0, saved across sessions) |
| `cover_size` | `640` | Album art fetch size in pixels |
| `search_limit` | `10` | Default number of search results |
| `drop_detection` | `true` | Enable beat/drop detection and color cycling |
| `always_color` | `true` | Always show album-art colors (not only during drops) |
| `pywal` | `false` | Use [Pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) palette instead of album-art colors (reads `~/.cache/wal/colors.json` on all platforms) |
| `calm_mode` | `false` | Static spectrum shape, no drop/beat effects |
| `show_controls_hint` | `true` | Show "Press ? for ctrl" hint in the corner |

## Performance

Lumitide is built for low resource usage. Typical figures on a modern machine:

| Metric | Idle | Playing |
|--------|------|---------|
| CPU | < 1% | 1–3% |
| RAM | ~5 MB | ~10 MB |

If RAM usage matters (e.g. on a low-power device), enabling `calm_mode` in config skips the beat/drop analysis thread entirely, keeping usage closer to the idle figure.

## Legal

Lumitide is an unofficial client. Use it only with a valid Tidal subscription and in accordance with [Tidal's Terms of Service](https://tidal.com/terms).

The app credentials bundled in `src/auth.rs` are not personal credentials. On Windows, Lumitide replicates the Tidal desktop app's PKCE auth flow to obtain lossless-capable tokens. On Linux/macOS it uses the same public client credentials as [python-tidal](https://github.com/tamland/python-tidal) and other open-source Tidal clients.
